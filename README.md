Password Complexity Checker And Generator  

The code you provided is a web page that generates a random password based on user input for password length and the types of characters to include. It also checks the strength of the generated password and any user-entered password. Additionally, it checks if the user-entered password has been compromised in data breaches using the "Have I Been Pwned" API. However, due to certain reasons, the implementation of the "Have I Been Pwned" API is not possible at the moment, but it will be added in the near future.

The code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface, style the page, and implement the functionality. The generatePassword() function generates a random password based on user input for password length and the types of characters to include. The checkPasswordStrength() function checks the strength of the generated password or any user-entered password. The checkPasswordLeaks() function checks if the user-entered password has been compromised in data breaches using the "Have I Been Pwned" API.
